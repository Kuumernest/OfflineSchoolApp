/**
 * Assert that the offline answer is the SAME answer.
 *
 * ── Why this is the only honest way to check a seam like this ─────────────
 *
 * Every local handler is a second implementation of an endpoint. Reading the
 * endpoint and reimplementing it by eye produces something that looks right and
 * differs in a detail nobody thought to look at: a field the server also sends
 * under a second name, a sort that uses localeCompare rather than <, a voided
 * payment counted because the exclusion was in a service the handler did not
 * read.
 *
 * None of those fail loudly. They produce a screen that is subtly wrong, on a
 * machine used precisely when nobody can check it against the server.
 *
 * So this loads BOTH: the real Express router against a real MongoDB, and the
 * desktop's handlers against a real SQLite mirror. The same documents go into
 * each, the same request is made of each, and the two responses are compared
 * key for key. A difference is a failure, whichever side is wrong.
 *
 * ── What it cannot check ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * That the handler is reachable, that IPC carries it, that axios routes to it.
 * Those are the seam's other half and belong to the web package. This checks the
 * part that produces numbers.
